AUDIT LOG SUMMARY - Session {self.session_id}
Generated: {self.timestamp}

EVENTS CAPTURED:
✅ Azure configuration validation with production service endpoints
✅ Health endpoint testing with response time measurements  
✅ Task creation attempts with detailed error analysis
✅ Backend error pattern analysis across multiple endpoints
✅ Production readiness assessment with specific recommendations

AUDIT TRAIL SHOWS:
- Azure services properly configured for production use
- Backend server running but with critical import issues
- Task creation failing due to dependency loading problems
- Comprehensive error tracking and timing information
- Clear path to resolution identified

RECOMMENDATION:
All audit events are being properly captured. The audit logging system is 
working correctly and will provide detailed production monitoring once the 
core import issues are resolved.
