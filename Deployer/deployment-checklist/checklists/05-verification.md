# Verification Checklist

## Verification Steps

1. **Access the Service Endpoints**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to the service endpoints provided after deployment.
   - Confirm that the application is accessible and does not display a blank or error page.

2. **Check Azure Portal for Resource Status**
   - Log in to the Azure Portal.
   - Navigate to the resource group created during deployment.
   - Verify that all resources (Container Apps, Cosmos DB, etc.) are listed and in a "Running" state.

3. **Run Validation Scripts**
   - Open a terminal in your development environment.
   - Execute the following PowerShell scripts in order:
     - `.\scripts\validate-prerequisites.ps1`
       - Ensure all prerequisites are met.
     - `.\scripts\validate-azure-setup.ps1`
       - Confirm that the Azure environment is correctly configured.
     - `.\scripts\validate-deployment.ps1`
       - Check the deployment status and ensure all components are functioning.

4. **Review Logs for Errors**
   - Access the logs generated during deployment.
   - Look for any error messages or warnings that may indicate issues with the deployment.

5. **Test Application Functionality**
   - Perform basic functionality tests on the application.
   - Ensure that all features are working as expected and that there are no broken links or missing resources.

6. **Confirm Data Persistence**
   - If applicable, check the Azure Cosmos DB to ensure that data is being stored and retrieved correctly.
   - Run queries to validate that the expected data is present.

7. **Monitor Application Performance**
   - Use Azure Monitor or Application Insights to check the performance metrics of the deployed application.
   - Ensure that response times are within acceptable limits and that there are no performance bottlenecks.

8. **Document Verification Results**
   - Record the results of each verification step in a log file or documentation.
   - Note any issues encountered and the steps taken to resolve them.

## Final Validation Round
- Conduct a final review of all verification steps to ensure completeness.
- Confirm that all services are operational and that the deployment meets the project requirements.
