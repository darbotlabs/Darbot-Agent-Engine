# Deployment Checklist

Welcome to the Deployment Checklist project! This repository is designed to provide a comprehensive guide for deploying your application to Azure. It includes detailed tasks, validation checkpoints, and scripts to ensure a smooth deployment process.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to streamline the deployment process by providing clear instructions and validation steps. This ensures that all necessary prerequisites are met, the Azure environment is correctly configured, and the deployment is successful.

## Features

- **Structured Checklists**: Step-by-step checklists for each phase of the deployment process.
- **Validation Scripts**: PowerShell scripts to validate prerequisites, Azure setup, and deployment status.
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Guidelines for cleaning up resources post-deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with the deployment process, follow these steps:

1. **Review Prerequisites**: Check the [01-prerequisites.md](checklists/01-prerequisites.md) file to ensure all necessary prerequisites are in place.
2. **Set Up Azure Environment**: Follow the instructions in [02-azure-setup.md](checklists/02-azure-setup.md) to configure your Azure environment.
3. **Project Setup**: Refer to [03-project-setup.md](checklists/03-project-setup.md) for local project setup instructions.
4. **Deployment**: Execute the steps outlined in [04-deployment.md](checklists/04-deployment.md) to deploy your application.
5. **Verification**: After deployment, verify the success of the process using [05-verification.md](checklists/05-verification.md).
6. **Cleanup**: Finally, follow the steps in [06-cleanup.md](checklists/06-cleanup.md) to clean up any resources that are no longer needed.

## Validation Checkpoints

For a successful deployment, ensure that you complete the validation checkpoints listed in [VALIDATION_CHECKPOINTS.md](VALIDATION_CHECKPOINTS.md) after each major step.

## Scripts

The following PowerShell scripts are included to assist with the deployment process:
All PowerShell scripts are located in the `scripts` directory.

- `validate-prerequisites.ps1`: Checks if all necessary prerequisites are met.
- `validate-azure-setup.ps1`: Verifies that the Azure environment is correctly configured.
- `validate-deployment.ps1`: Checks the deployment status and functionality of components.
- `cleanup.ps1`: Cleans up resources after deployment.

## Conclusion

By following this checklist and utilizing the provided scripts, you can ensure a successful deployment of your application to Azure. For any questions or issues, please refer to the documentation or reach out for support. Happy deploying!
