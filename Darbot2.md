Let me check the requirements.txt file to see the dependencies: Let's verify if all these dependencies are installed: Now, let me explain what needs to be done to configure and run the backend environment:

1. It looks like you already have a virtual environment set up (as indicated by the "(backend)" prefix in your terminal) and the dependencies appear to be installed.

2. You need to create a `.env` file based on the template provided (.env.template) to set up your environment variables. This file should include your Azure service endpoints and authentication configuration.

3. Then you can run the backend service using the `uvicorn` command as mentioned in the README.

Let's start by creating a basic `.env` file with the minimum required configuration for development: 

Made changes.

Now, let's try starting the backend service. According to the README, you can start it using: Summarized conversation historyI'll help you set up the backend environment for the Darbot-Agent-Engine project. Let's continue by creating a proper `.env` file and addressing the port binding issue.

First, let's check if there's an .env.template file we can use as a reference: Great! Let's look at the template to understand what environment variables we need to configure: 

Now, let's also check the app_config.py file to understand how these environment variables are used: Now, let's examine the app_kernel.py file to understand how the backend starts up and what ports it's using: Let's continue reading to understand the FastAPI app setup: Let's continue exploring to get more context about the port configuration: 

Let's also look at the config_kernel.py file for more configuration details: 

Now let's create a `.env` file with minimal required configuration for development purposes. We'll set up a basic configuration that allows the application to start and run locally: Let's check if the .env file already exists: Now I'll update the .env file with more appropriate values for local development: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now that we've updated the .env file, let's address the port binding issue by modifying the port number. We'll use port 8080 instead of 8000: Great! Now let's try running the backend service with a different port (8080) to avoid the permission issue: 

Let's check the terminal output to see if the server started successfully: 

Great! The backend service is now running successfully on port 8080. Let's update the .env file to reflect this change in the `BACKEND_API_URL`: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let's test the API by accessing the health check endpoint: Let's check if there are any API endpoints we can access to verify the server is working correctly: Great! The FastAPI Swagger UI is accessible, which confirms our server is running correctly. Let's open the Swagger UI in the browser to explore the available endpoints: ## Summary of Setup

You've successfully set up the backend environment for the Darbot-Agent-Engine project:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Created and updated the .env file with placeholder values for local development
   - The actual values should be replaced with your real Azure resource details when you're ready to connect to actual services

2. **Backend Service**:
   - Successfully started the backend service on port 8080 (changed from 8000 to avoid permission issues)
   - Verified the service is running by accessing the Swagger UI at http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs

3. **Next Steps**:
   - To connect to real Azure services, you should update the .env file with your actual:
     - Azure tenant ID
     - Subscription ID
     - Azure OpenAI endpoint
     - CosmosDB endpoint
     - AI Foundry connection details
   - You'll need to log in with the Azure CLI using `az login` for local development with DefaultAzureCredential

4. **Port Configuration**:
   - Updated the `BACKEND_API_URL` in .env to use port 8080 instead of 8000
   - The backend service is now accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8080

The server is running in the background and can be accessed for API calls. When you want to stop it, you can press CTRL+C in the terminal where it's running.
